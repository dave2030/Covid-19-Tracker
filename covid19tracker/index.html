    <h3 style="text-align: left">
      As of Sunday at 11:35 am CST, more than 9,942,075 doses of approved
      COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across Canada.
    </h3>
    <p>
      As provinces across Canada begin their COVID-19 vaccination programs,
      we're tracking doses administered in every region of Canada.<br /><br />
      166,808 new doses have been reported administered today.<br /><br />

      In total, 12,654,010 doses of COVID-19 vaccines (including Moderna,
      Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca) have been delivered to the provinces for
      administration.<br /><br />
      As of today, 78.6% of doses delivered to the provinces have been
      administered.<br /><br />

      The Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines require two doses, a
      number of weeks apart, for full efficacy. <br /><br />Consequently, we
      report both the total number of doses administered, and the total number
      of Canadians who have been fully vaccinated. <br /><br />As of today, more
      than 9,029,209 Canadians have received at least one dose of an approved
      COVID-19 vaccine. 912,866 Canadians are fully vaccinated against COVID-19,
      having received both required doses.
